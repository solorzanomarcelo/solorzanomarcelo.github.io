Marcelo,Solórzano Astorga,,,,Software Developer,"As a child, I loved writing stories; now, I channel that creativity into writing code. I am a software engineer with 5+ years of experience contributing to the design and development of high-performance, user-centric applications that deliver value.  I have discovered a deep passion for mobile and web development, which has become a central focus of my career. Along the way, I’ve embraced opportunities to switch between roles, challenging me to adapt to different programming paradigms. These experiences have provided me with a broader understanding of how different technologies and architectural solutions integrate to create cohesive systems.  In my spare time, I dedicate myself to developing video games, leveraging my technical background to turn ideas into reality. This year, I am excited to release my first game, with details soon to be announced—stay tuned!",Software Development,,"San Jose, Costa Rica",,,
